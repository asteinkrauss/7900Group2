# ADAN-ADEC7900 Group 2
dataset of median income of Americans and fruit and vegetables from 2013, 2016, 2020

# Define the research question

We aim to analyze the affordability of fruits and vegetables based on the average American household income by state over multiple years. We hope to investigate whether income constraints influence access to fresh produce versus alternative forms (i.e., canned/frozen) and how this impacts adherence to dietary guidelines. The findings could inform policymakers responsible for food pricing regulations and programs like food stamps, helping them understand the challenges individuals and families face in accessing nutritious foods and potentially guiding adjustments to policies or interventions aimed at improving dietary habits
